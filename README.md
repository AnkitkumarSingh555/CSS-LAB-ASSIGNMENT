1.Explain box model with an example
The CSS box model is a fundamental concept in web design that defines how elements are structured and displayed on a webpage. It consists of four main components: content, padding, border, and margin.
Content: This is the innermost part of the box where text, images, or other media are displayed. The width and height properties directly affect the size of the content area.
Padding: Padding is the space between the content and the border. It creates a buffer around the content, ensuring that it doesnâ€™t touch the border. Padding is transparent and can be adjusted using the padding property in CSS.
Border: The border surrounds the padding and content. It can be styled using properties like border-width, border-style, and border-color. The border adds visual separation between the content and the margin.
Margin: The margin is the outermost layer, creating space between the element and its neighboring elements. Margins are also transparent and can be set using the margin property.Example of box model.
